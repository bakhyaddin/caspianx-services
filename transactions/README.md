Every institution has a code which inherits from the [SAME LIST](https://muhasib.az/Muhasibat/teshkili/hesablar_plani_yeni.php). This means both your contumers (Nargiz, Safa hospital) and the companies that you make transactions to (SOCAR) inherits their codes from the same list of codes.

When we create an institution we will ask the client to define if it is a one that is his/hers contracted ones. If yes we will need to create a REALM in keycloak.
